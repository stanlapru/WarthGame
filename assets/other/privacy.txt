Warth stores and processes certain data in order to work.
Upon first launch, Warth will prompt you to either Sign In or Register.
Having an account and being Signed in is required to connect to the game servers and play Warth.

Registration is required to create an account.

The following data is required to create an account:
1. Your E-mail;
2. Your Password;
3. Your Nickname.

Should you so choose, you may also create an account and Sign In using Google Play Games, which will share the E-mail for the Google Account
associated with Play Games with the developers of Warth.

Upon accessing the server, which happens on sign-in, your IP address is shared with the server, which may be used to determine the country
the request was sent from. Country deducted from the IP address is set to hidden to other players by default and may be enabled should the 
player so choose. 

Account data and IP address is also sent to the server upon joining a match for verification purposes and to update the list of match
participants. 

Upon making a turn in a match, data relating to the player's turn is sent to the server. This is done to calculate the results of the turn,
which are then shortly sent to the players participating in this match. This behaviour is repeated until the match is over.

All data is sent over a secure connection and cannot be read by any malicious actor, and will never be shared with or sold to anyone.

Should the player choose to delete their account, they may do so by contacting the developers by E-mail. 
Exact UID, Password, Nickname and E-mail are required to make the request. 
Once the request is accepted, the account will be Set for Deletion. This state will last for 7 days to allow a player to reverse their 
choice. 
The account and associated data will be deleted permanently after this time period passes.
